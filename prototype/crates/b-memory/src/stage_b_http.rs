//! Stage B feature-gated Walrus testnet HTTP client.
//!
//! This module mints [`StageBReqwestWalrusClient`] — the Walrus testnet client
//! HTTP client wrapper, built on top of
//! [`WalrusTestnetEndpoint`](crate::stage_b_walrus_endpoint::WalrusTestnetEndpoint).
//!
//! ## Default build has no live network
//!
//! [`StageBReqwestWalrusClient`] and every `reqwest`-backed type it holds are
//! gated behind the crate feature `net-testnet`. The default build compiles this
//! module to **nothing network-bearing**: the client type does not exist, and no
//! `reqwest`/HTTP/TLS surface is reachable. `b-memory` declares **no direct
//! `reqwest` dependency**; its `net-testnet` feature simply forwards to
//! `mnemos-c-walrus/net-testnet`, so the transport code lives in the raw-transport
//! crate (`c-walrus`) and the orchestration wrapper lives here. This keeps the
//! crate dependency edge one-way (`b-memory -> c-walrus`) and avoids the
//! `c-walrus -> b-memory -> c-walrus` cycle that hosting the wrapper in `c-walrus`
//! would form.
//!
//! ## Crate-home rationale
//!
//! [`WalrusTestnetEndpoint`] is a `b-memory` type. Hosting the client in
//! `c-walrus` would require `c-walrus` to import a `b-memory` type and form a
//! cargo-rejected dependency cycle (`cargo metadata` confirms
//! `b-memory -> c-walrus` and `c-walrus -> {}`). Walrus client wrappers live in
//! `b-memory`; `c-walrus` stays raw transport.
//!
//! ## Testnet-only, timeout-bounded, redaction-by-construction
//!
//! The only constructor is [`StageBReqwestWalrusClient::testnet`]: it binds the
//! single sanctioned [`WalrusTestnetEndpoint::testnet`] endpoint (no host/path/
//! network parameter, so `mainnet` is *not representable*) and builds both the
//! Stage A [`ReqwestPublisher`] and [`ReqwestAggregator`] with the same
//! per-attempt timeout. A zero timeout is rejected fail-closed (delegated to the
//! Stage A transport constructors, which reject it with
//! [`ReqwestTransportInitError::TimeoutZero`] — a blocking client without a
//! positive timeout could hang forever). The error type carries only a
//! static diagnostic label (no host, no body, no third-party `Error` text), so a
//! construction failure cannot leak anything.
//!
//! This module is the client *seam* only: it constructs and holds the transports
//! and exposes the bound endpoint, network, timeout and response body cap. It does
//! **not** perform any PUT/GET (the request planners / parsers live elsewhere) and
//! never opens a socket — building a `reqwest::blocking::Client` is offline; the
//! connection pool is lazy and no request is issued in this module or its tests.
//!
